About

Data and Algorithms are my fascination. Fortunately, my career spanning the last two decades involved building data-enabled enterprise software systems. In my initial years at GE, I was fortunate to work on large-scale data-powered recommender systems for Industrial, Retail, and Aviation verticals. If asked to summarize my experience, saying "Technology evangelist and intrapreneur" would be apt.

I have authored two books,

*Python data science cookbook* - Published by Pack Publication. No longer in print. The plan is to open-source the contents with some more relevant modifications. First published in 2015, Python and its ecosystem have come a long way.

[A Chinese translation is available.](https://www.tenlong.com.tw/products/9781784396404)

I was happy to see this book referenced by a few universities for their data science coursework.

- [Annamalai University Bachelors of Engineering, Reference book for their Data Science course.](https://annamalaiuniversity.ac.in/studport/download/Handbook/2020-21/Engg/CSE/B.E_CSE_(DS)_Handbook_R2019.pdf)

- North Eastern University, Bost Chapters 6,8 and 9

*R Data Analysis Projects*, published by Packt in 2017
