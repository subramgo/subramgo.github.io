## PEP-515 Underscores in Numeric Literals

Using visual separators in numbers helps us comprehend large numbers. PEP-515 has
introduced this feature in python.


    # separator by thousands
    ten_thousand = 10_000.0
    hundred_thousand = 100_000.0


The underscores in numeric literals shown above help improve readability.

String formatting also supports underscore syntax.

    print("{:_}".format(123456789))
    123_456_789
